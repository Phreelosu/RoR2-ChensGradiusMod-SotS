- Fix more syncing and networking issues. Hopefully that is all of them.

**1.3.3**
- Disable debug version. I am so sorry.

- Update the icon for Gradius' Option.
- Let Turret Drones have Rotate Options, Options that orbit around the turret.
- Resize the Pickup models for Options as they were too large.

**1.3.1**
